Arduino library with base type definitions.


## Requirements

  * arduino-cli
  * bash


## Install

Run [Install.sh](Install.sh).

## Details

Naming of base types that suits my current taste.

Just a fancy naming of base C types to what may be called Pascal-style.

Still it's a required definitions for all other my libraries and projects.
